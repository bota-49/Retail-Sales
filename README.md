# Retail Sales Analysis Using SQL

This project analyzes retail sales data using SQL to uncover trends, performance indicators, and insights that support data-driven business decisions.

## Objective
To evaluate product performance, sales trends, and customer behavior across various regions and time periods using structured queries on transactional retail data.

## Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)**: All data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis tasks were performed using SQL only.

## Project Workflow
1. Raw transactional data was imported into a relational database.
2. SQL queries were written to:
   - Aggregate total and average sales per product/category
   - Analyze monthly and regional sales performance
   - Identify best-selling and low-performing items
   - Segment customers by purchase frequency and value

3. Views and subqueries were used to structure complex insights.

## Key Insights
- Identified top-performing products across categories
- Discovered sales seasonality patterns and regional differences
- Highlighted underperforming SKUs for potential optimization
- Segmented customer base for targeted campaigns

## Files Included
- `Retail_Sales_Analysis.sql`: Full SQL script used in analysis
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation

## Notes
This project focuses entirely on SQL for analytical processing and showcases how business insights can be derived directly from structured data sources without external BI tools.
